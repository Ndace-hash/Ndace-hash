### Hi there 👋

I am Zaccheaus, a frontend web developer
<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my Technical and soft skills as a developer. It would be nice to connect with you, `check out my social media below, if you'd like to connect.`
  <br>
  <br>

- ### 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue Js(javascript framework).

  It has been fun and awesome so far with learning vue. I haven't migrated to Vue3 though I still use Vue2. I picked Vue because it has a easier learning curve.
  <br>
  <br>

- ### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have need for a frontend developer's skill and also projects that provoke the brain to think hard.

<br>

- ### 🤔 I’m looking for help with Front-End implementations.

<br>
